# Senior Data Developer

Montréal, Quebec, Canada

At Poka, we’re transforming how frontline teams operate, learn, and solve problems.

Our connected worker platform is purpose-built for manufacturing, empowering frontline workers to share knowledge, collaborate in real-time, and drive continuous improvement. Think of it as the missing digital link, bringing the human interface into the stack of the Smart Factory, generating the right data and insights that drive entirely new scales of process improvements.

We’re proud to support global leaders like Nestlé, Bosch, Mars, and Danone in their digital transformation journeys and as part of the IFS family, our reach and impact continue to grow globally.

The Analytics team is responsible for developing Poka’s data analytics platform and managing a wide range of services and tools to store, transform, and analyze the use of our application by our customers and their factories. These internal products provide visibility on Poka usage, both internally and for production line managers, enabling them to make informed strategic decisions.
