**ABOUT THE ROLE**

We are looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to be a technical leader on our foundational **Platform** team. This team builds the connective tissue of our product—the core services, APIs, and integration frameworks that link Procurify to our customers' most critical financial and HR systems.

In this role, you will be a hands-on expert in building robust, scalable integrations. You will own the design and development of our connections to key **Accounting and ERP platforms**, enabling seamless data flow and unlocking powerful automated workflows for our customers. You are passionate about API design, solving complex integration challenges, and mentoring other engineers to elevate the team's capabilities.

### WHAT YOU’LL BE WORKING ON

- **Design & Build Core APIs:** Take a leading role in designing, building, and maintaining our internal and external APIs. You will be a key contributor to our API-first strategy, using modern Python frameworks like **FastAPI** to create services that are a joy for other developers to use.
- **Build & Maintain Key Integrations:** You will be the hands-on expert for our ecosystem of third-party integrations. You’ll be responsible for building and maintaining resilient connections to critical **Accounting/ERP systems (e.g., QuickBooks Online, NetSuite, Microsoft Business Central)**.
- **Elevate our Platform Architecture:** Contribute to the long-term vision for our integration platform. You will help design and implement scalable, observable, and resilient systems capable of handling a high volume of data from thousands of customers.
- **Mentor & Grow Teammates:** As a senior engineer, you will act as a technical mentor for other engineers on the team. You will lead by example in code reviews, share your expertise in technical design sessions, and help foster a culture of engineering excellence.
- **Our Tech Stack:**
	- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
	- **Cloud:** AWS
	- **Infrastructure & Containers:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
	- **Integration Tools:** Experience with iPaaS (e.g., Workato, Merge) is a plus

### WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR

- **Senior Backend Experience:** 5+ years of software engineering experience with a deep focus on backend development, particularly in a cloud-native or SaaS environment.
- **API & Services Expertise:** Proven expertise in designing, building, and maintaining resilient, scalable APIs and backend services. You have a strong command of **Python** and experience with modern frameworks (e.g., **FastAPI**, Flask, Django).
- **Deep Integration Experience:** A strong track record of building and maintaining complex third-party API integrations. Direct, hands-on experience with **Accounting/ERP systems (NetSuite, QuickBooks Online, etc.)** is a major advantage.
- **Architectural Mindset:** A strong grasp of distributed systems, microservice architecture, and API-first design principles. You know how to make pragmatic architectural decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term scalability.
- **Mentorship Experience:** You have a passion for leveling up your teammates and experience mentoring other engineers in areas like technical design, coding best practices, and problem-solving.
- **Empathetic & Accountable:** A collaborative leader who takes initiative and ownership. You believe that your team’s success is your success and excel at communicating complex technical ideas clearly.
